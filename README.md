# Pokemon-Teams

## Overview

### This project is about my favorite team's for some pokemon games, that are the best to finish the game, using good combinations of strong pokemons from several different pokemon types.<br />

### Each team features a different set of pokemons that you can use in the specified pokemon game, you can look at their types, stats, description, etc...<br />To toggle the pokemon's data type (basic/advanced) you simply need to click on the pokemon card. <br />
